# SQL 50

This repository contains:

- Some of my previous solutions for LeetCode's [SQL 50 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/)
- A docker compose file to help facilitate local practice/testing

Some problem files will contain creates and inserts to help build the test cases locally, but some of the earlier problems don't as I wasn't doing this at first.

## Using Docker Compose

To use the compose file, all it requires is a `.env` file

Example:
```
PG_USER=user
PG_PASS=password99
PGADMIN_USER=user@user.com
PGADMIN_PASS=password99
```
